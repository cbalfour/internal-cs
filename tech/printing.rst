Printing
========

The Department operates a number of network-attached printers. The printer usage is dependent on the type of user (staff or student) and type of student (Honours or Postgraduate) - refer to the table.

In September 2010, the Department implemented a print accounting system to assist with the management of printing costs and to ensure cost effectiveness. Printing to the printers are enabled through the departments accounting based print servers; \\ps1.cs.uct.ac.za (Unix) or \\ps0.cs.uct.ac.za (Windows).

The print accounting system is operated in page counting mode.

Please be mindful of the amount you print as you will be asked to justify excessive printing.
