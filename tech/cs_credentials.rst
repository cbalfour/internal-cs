CS Authentication Credentials
=============================

Most Computer Science IT services are accessed using your CS unix or Windows
credentials. These are **not** the same as your UCT credentials which you use
to access Vula and the PeopleSoft student system. 

These credentials are usually sent to you via email at the beginning of second undergraduate year.

If you do not have CS credentials, please contact the :ref:`sysadmins-label`.
