Printing
========

The Department operates a number of network-attached printers. The printer usage is dependent on the type of user (staff or student) and type of student (Honours or Postgraduate).

.. note:: The Department uses a print accounting system to assist with the management of printing costs and to ensure cost effectiveness.  The print accounting system is operated in page counting mode.

.. warning:: Please be mindful of the amount you print as you will be asked to justify excessive printing.

We do not currently provide any printing services in the Senior or
Ishango Labs.
