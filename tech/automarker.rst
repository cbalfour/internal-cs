Automatic Marker
================

The automatic marker is an extension to the UCT Vula learning management
system to automatically mark programming assignments. It usually appears 
as ``Automatic Marker`` in the left sidebar of Vula course sites that 
use it. 

This system is managed by the :ref:`scientific_officers` together with the
:ref:`sysadmins-label`.
