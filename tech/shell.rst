Shell Server
============

The shell server provides remote command-line access to a unix server via the secure shell (ssh) protocol.

The shell server's name is ``nightmare.cs.uct.ac.za``.

Connect to it with an ssh client, such as ``ssh`` on most unix systems, or 
`Putty`_ in Windows.

Login with your CS unix credentials.
